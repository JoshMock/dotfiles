# SOURCE CONTROL ALL THE REPOS

These are my dotfiles, guys. Nothing special, really. Lots of
heavily-documented Vim, bash and zsh config files. And a crap-ton of Vim
plugins (installed and managed using
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)) great for making Vim (my primary
text editor) act more like what's expected of a modern-day code editor.

## Installation/Management

I manage my dotfiles using the conveniently-named Python package
[dotfiles](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dotfiles), which is extremely handy for
setting up all your $HOME symlinks for you and keeping them in sync.

## License

I can't license other people's submodules obviously, but for anything that
isn't already licensed, assume the [WTFPL license](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/).

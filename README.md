# SOURCE CONTROL ALL THE REPOS

These are my dotfiles, guys. Nothing special, really.

## Stuff I use

- zsh (instead of bash)
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) for all the goodies
- [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/) as my primary editor
- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) for Vim plugin management
- A ton of Vim plugins (check my [.vimrc](https://github.com/JoshMock/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc) for a current list)

## Installation/Management

I manage my dotfiles using the conveniently-named Python package
[dotfiles](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dotfiles), which is extremely handy for
setting up all your $HOME symlinks for you and keeping them in sync.

## License

I can't license other people's submodules obviously, but for anything that
isn't already licensed, assume the [WTFPL license](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/).
